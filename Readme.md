Add games to the launcher is super easy - click n go!



If the Game Cover or Background is not automatically loading up after adding the game -

**Click *the cloud icon* after Game Name to force load.**

If that doesn't help either - 

**You can always *manually change*, edit or select the Game Description, Cover and Background Image.**



For Steam Games, sometimes the game doesn't want to be run from any other installer or from the directory path and wants to be run from STEAM Launcher.

In that case -

1. **Just go to that steam game page in the steam launcher**
2. ***Copy the steam link* for the game**
3. **Slam it into the *Game Directory/Path* in SISsyLauncher**
4. **Boom, it will run!**
